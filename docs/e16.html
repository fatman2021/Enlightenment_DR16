The Window Manager controls the
      appearance of the borders of your windows, their behavior and all user
      interaction with positioning, killing, resizing, moving, iconifying,
      shading etc. your windows, virtual desktops, multiple desktops, menus
      attached to windows and some root window menus and can also control the
      background of your desktop(s).</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm908238708"></a>The Desktop</h3></div></div></div><p>The first time e16 is started the desktop will look as described
      below.</p><p>Across the whole top of the screen you will see a bar with arrows
      pointing up and down on the left and right ends. This is your desktop
      <a class="link" href="#dragbar" title="The Dragbar">dragbar</a>.</p><p>On the bottom-left you'll see the <a class="link" href="#pager" title="The Pager">pagers</a> for desktops 0 and 1.</p><p>On the bottom-right you'll see an <a class="link" href="#iconbox" title="The Iconbox">iconbox</a>.</p><p>Everything else is your desktop <a class="link" href="#backgrounds" title="Selecting and Adding backgrounds">background</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="rootmenu"></a>Menus</h3></div></div></div><p>When you click with your left mouse button on the desktop <a class="link" href="#backgrounds" title="Selecting and Adding backgrounds">background</a> you will see the "User Menus"
      menu appear. Applications you may have installed will appear in this
      menu. To launch one of them simply select it from the menu.</p><p>Clicking the middle button on the desktop <a class="link" href="#backgrounds" title="Selecting and Adding backgrounds">background</a> will display e16's main menu.
      You can access the other menus plus more options from this menu
      (including those to log out, restart and display Help
      information).</p><p>When you click the right mouse button the "Settings" menu will
      appear. From it you can enter the Settings Dialog, change background and
      theme, log out, etc. The <a class="link" href="#settings" title="Settings">Settings Dialog</a>
      allows you to customize your desktop to better suit your needs.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="mousebind"></a>Mouse Bindings</h3></div></div></div><p>Of course, when you click on the <a class="link" href="#desktops" title="Multiple &amp; Virtual Desktops">desktop</a> <a class="link" href="#backgrounds" title="Selecting and Adding backgrounds">background</a> of your screen, normally you
      will bring up a <a class="link" href="#rootmenu" title="Menus">menu</a>. And of course,
      when you click on the <a class="link" href="#border" title="Using the Window Border">border</a> of a window,
      you will do various things.</p><p>In e16, there are several other actions that the mouse can do by
      default. For example, by holding down the ALT key when you click the
      left mouse button anywhere in a window, you will find that you can <a class="link" href="#movemode" title="Moving Windows">move</a> the window around the screen, just as if
      you had used the title bar. You can also ALT middle-click in a window to
      <a class="link" href="#resizemode" title="Resizing Windows">resize</a> it, or use ALT and right-click
      to bring up the <a class="link" href="#windowops" title="The Window Operations Menu">Window Operations
      Menu</a>.</p><p>Holding down the ALT key while clicking the middle mouse button on
      the background of your <a class="link" href="#desktops" title="Multiple &amp; Virtual Desktops">desktop</a> will
      bring up a menu with the titles of all currently active application
      windows. Selecting one of these will take you to that application. By
      using the CTRL key instead of ALT you will get a menu displaying all
      current desktops as sub-menus, with applications on each desktop in the
      desktop sub-menu.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="mouseconfig"></a>Mouse Configuration</h3></div></div></div><p>E16 makes extensive use of the mouse. However, you may be missing
      some features because of the way that your mouse is configured on your X
      server.</p><p>If your mouse does not have a middle button you should enable
      "Emulate 3 Buttons" in your X server. This option allows you to emulate
      a three-button mouse by pressing both left and right mouse buttons at
      once. If this does not work, three-button emulation may not be enabled.
      See your X server documentation to configure this emulation.</p><p>This may vary from system to system. The OS and X server may also
      vary the method in which you do this, if it is possible. Not having a
      middle mouse button in e16, or for that matter X, is not a good thing as
      it is almost assumed to be there, and is used by many applications,
      including E.</p><p>If you have a Wheel-Mouse and X is configured to use it, e16
      supports it by default.</p><p>Rolling your wheel up on the desktop background will take you back
      a <a class="link" href="#desktops" title="Multiple &amp; Virtual Desktops">desktop</a>. Rolling your wheel downward
      you will advance forward a desktop.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="border"></a>Using the Window Border</h3></div></div></div><p>When you start an application, unless it has special properties,
      it will come up on your screen with a border surrounding it that
      contains a title bar and several control buttons. This border is the
      primary interface to controlling an application window. The default
      setup gives adequate control but still retains simplicity.</p><p>If you click left mouse button on the title bar and keep the mouse
      button down the window will follow your mouse wherever it moves.
      Respectively if you click your left mouse button and drag on any of the
      resize handles, the window will be resized in that direction. Clicking
      right mouse button on the resize handles will raise the windows to the
      top.</p><p>Clicking right mouse button on the title bar or any button on the
      window operations menu button on the top-left will display a menu that
      has window manipulation options in it.</p><p>Double-clicking the title bar will make the window shade or
      unshade.</p><p>Clicking left mouse button on the iconify button will iconify the
      window and send it off to the <a class="link" href="#iconbox" title="The Iconbox">iconbox</a>.
      Hitting the Maximize button will maximize the size of the application
      fill your screen. Hitting it again will unmaximize, bringing the window
      back to its normal size.</p><p>Clicking with the left mouse button on the close button will close
      the window. If the application that owns that window does not respond to
      a nice request to exit, then press the right mouse button on the close
      button to forcibly terminate that window. This should not be used unless
      the application is visibly "hung".</p><p>In addition to these methods, there are additional ways to
      manipulate windows.</p><p>If you hold down the ALT key and hold down left mouse button
      anywhere in the window (on the border OR in the application part) while
      dragging, you will move this window around. Doing the same but with the
      middle mouse button will resize the window in that direction. Clicking
      the right mouse button anywhere in the window while holding down the ALT
      key will bring up the window operations menu.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="changeborder"></a>Changing Window Borders</h3></div></div></div><p>You may find that you don't like a particular border that a window
      uses, for some reason or another. You can easily change the border style
      of a window in e16 using the <a class="link" href="#windowops" title="The Window Operations Menu">Window
      Operations</a> menu, however. Select the "Set Border Style" menu, and
      a list will be presented to you of available borders in this theme. The
      most common use for this is to make an application shed its border,
      using the BORDERLESS border type.</p><p>You can always click with ALT + Right mouse button anywhere in the
      window to bring up the window operations menu again.</p><p>If you want to remember the border style for the next time you run
      this application, you can always use the <a class="link" href="#properties" title="Remembering Application Properties">Remember</a> dialog to remember the current
      window border.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="defkeys"></a>Default Keybindings</h3></div></div></div><p>Below are the keybindings for e16 as it comes "from the

There are
      distinct difference between the two, and e16 treats them
      differently.</p><p>When you start e16 you will by default have two desktops. In e16
      desktops are geometrically unrelated work areas. They are visually
      stacked on top of each other and can even be dragged down to expose
      desktops underneath.</p><p>The best way to imagine this is that each desktop is a sheet of
      paper with the first desktop (desktop 0) being glued in-place. You can
      re-shuffle the stack of papers and slide one down to reveal a piece of
      paper underneath - the only paper you can't slide is the first one. Each
      desktop (or sheet) contains your application windows.</p><p>Windows normally live on one desktop, but can be made to exist on
      all desktops - whenever you change to a new desktop the window will
      follow you and be on that desktop too. This is known as being sticky. if
      a window is sticky it will "stick to the glass of your screen" and stay
      there until it is not sticky anymore or the window is closed.</p><p>Virtual desktops (also known as desktop areas) is a measure of how
      big your desktops are. A desktop can be a multiple of your screen size
      in size (2x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x2 etc.). That means each desktop has an AxB
      screen size of area allocated to it and you can be looking at any
      screen-sized part of it at any time. It's just like getting more sheets
      of paper and taping them to the sides of your current sheet of paper. An
      easy way of changing your view is by just sliding your mouse in the
      direction of a currently unviewable part of your desktop. As long as you
      have Edge Flip enabled e16 will automatically scroll over to that part
      of the desktop.</p><p>To change the number of virtual desktops that you have, select
      "Desks" in the <a class="link" href="#settings" title="Settings">Settings Dialog</a>.</p><p>To change the number of virtual areas, select "Areas" in the <a class="link" href="#settings" title="Settings">Settings Dialog</a>. Use the slider bars to extend
      the size of the virtual areas to the size that you prefer. You can also
      use this dialog to enable/disable edge resistance (when your <a class="link" href="#mousebind" title="Mouse Bindings">mouse</a> hits the edge of an area) moving
      between virtual areas.</p><p>E16 also allows you to set a different desktop backdrop per
      desktop to help you customize your environment and differentiate which
      desktop is which.</p><p>An easy way of having e16 automatically pick up any pictures you
      have is to make a directory in your ~/.e16 directory called backgrounds
      and then fill that with your favorite backdrops. E16 will automatically
      discover this and index them for you allowing you to select them and
      change their settings. More on this topic is explained in the <a class="link" href="#backgrounds" title="Selecting and Adding backgrounds">Desktop Backgrounds</a> section.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="changedesk"></a>Changing Desktops</h3></div></div></div><p>There are several ways that you can change your current desktop -

      desktop to another. We'll go over a few of them now.</p><p>The first way you can move apps between desktops is using the
      <a class="link" href="#pager" title="The Pager">Pager</a>.</p><p>You can also move applications between desktops using the <a class="link" href="#dragbar" title="The Dragbar">Dragbar</a>.</p><p>You can also move applications between desktops using the KDE or
      GNOME desktop pagers.</p><p>You can also <a class="link" href="#movemode" title="Moving Windows">move</a> a window, then

      thin bar that looks something like the bar pictured below. This is
      called your Dragbar. It gets its name from its primary purpose, which is
      dragging desktops around.</p><p>If you are on any desktop except desktop 0, you can pick up and
      move that desktop in another direction. <a class="link" href="#desktops" title="Multiple &amp; Virtual Desktops">Desktops</a> documentation has more information on
      how to change desktops. Once you have dragged a desktop down, you can
      proceed to move windows between desktops this way, instead of using the
      <a class="link" href="#pager" title="The Pager">pager</a>.</p><p>You can also use the Dragbar to retrieve window lists. Use the
      middle mouse button to retrieve a window list, and the right mouse
      button for a window list sorted by desktops.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pager"></a>The Pager</h3></div></div></div><p>Pagers may not be a new idea in desktop environments, but the
      Pager in e16 is a highly advanced and highly configurable tool for
      desktop and window control, as well as a navigation tool.</p><p>The pager lets you see your desktop screen area in miniature. It
      lets you click on a certain desktop to "visit" it, click and drag
      windows around in the pager itself to move them about the screen
      quickly, or between <a class="link" href="#desktops" title="Multiple &amp; Virtual Desktops">desktops</a>.</p><p>Dragging a window from one area of a pager to another will move it
      there, or to another desktop. Dragging it out onto the actual desktop
      will drop that window right there. You can also drag a window into the
      <a class="link" href="#iconbox" title="The Iconbox">Iconbox</a> to iconify the window.</p><p>Pressing right-mouse button over a blank portion of the pager gets
      you the pager menu. This will allow you to set a couple of quick
      options. For more available options, you can select the "Pager Settings"
      item, which will pop up the Pager Settings dialog.</p><p>This dialog box will allow you to set all sorts of additional
      parameters, many of which can increase the performance of e16 on your
      system. Disabling high quality snapshots and/or snapshots in general as
      well as continuous updates can seriously improve performance - these
      features are intended for high end machines.</p><p>You can resize the pager to make it the size you'd like. Hold down
      ALT and use the middle-mouse button to resize the pager in any
      direction. Using left-mouse button while holding ALT and dragging will
      move the window. Holding down ALT while pressing right-mouse button,
      just like any normal window will get you a window operations
      menu.</p><p>In the default theme clicking the tab on the right side of the
      pager with the arrow pointing right will shade and unshade the pager
      window horizontally, allowing you to hide and unhide the window
      easily.</p><p>The striped area above this tab on the pager's border is a handle
      that will allow you to move the pager about, just like the title bar of
      any window.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="iconbox"></a>The Iconbox</h3></div></div></div><p>The iconbox is the place the icons for all your iconified windows
      go. It is one method of recovering <a class="link" href="#minimized" title="Recovering Minimized Applications">minimized</a> applications. Whenever you iconify
      or minimize a window it will go into an iconbox and have an icon
      displayed for it there. Clicking on the icon again will de-iconify
      it.</p><p>You can have as many icon boxes on your desktop as you want to.
      You can create more by using the Middle Click <a class="link" href="#rootmenu" title="Menus">Menu</a> - select Desktop-&gt;Create New Iconbox
      and a new Iconbox will pop up on your desktop. Each of these Iconboxes
      can have individual configurations, as detailed on the next page.</p><p>You can <a class="link" href="#movemode" title="Moving Windows">move</a> the Iconbox around
      the screen using Alt-Leftclick on the window, and then moving it to the
      desired location on the screen. You can <a class="link" href="#resizemode" title="Resizing Windows">resize</a> the Iconbox by alt-middleclicking on
      the window and then adjusting the size as described in the <a class="link" href="#mousebind" title="Mouse Bindings">Mouse Bindings</a> section.</p><p>Clicking the right-mouse button anywhere in the Iconbox will bring
      up a menu to configure that iconbox. This menu will look a little
      something like the one here to the right. This menu allows you to also
      close the Iconbox or open up an additional Iconbox.</p><p>To change the settings of an individual Iconbox, use the right
      mouse button <a class="link" href="#mousebind" title="Mouse Bindings">menu</a> and select
      "Settings". You can change the orientation, icon size, scrollbar
      options, display policy, base image, and many more options of the
      Iconbox from this dialog. You may choose to change the anchor of
      alignment for resizes - play with it until it resizes appropriately for
      your Iconbox location.</p><p>If you want to customize the images used for the icons in your
      iconbox, there is already an example configuration supplied. To make
      your own configuration copy the matches.cfg file installed in your e16
      system config directory (/usr/local/e16/config/matches.cfg or
      /usr/share/e16/config/matches.cfg) to your ~/.e16 directory and then
      edit it.</p><p>There are several examples of using the globbing and matching in

      additions.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="minimized"></a>Recovering Minimized Applications</h3></div></div></div><p>There are several ways to recover an application once you have
      minimized it. The most obvious way is to use the <a class="link" href="#iconbox" title="The Iconbox">Iconbox</a>. Of course, you might have had some
      applications in your Iconbox when you accidentally closed it. Or maybe
      you minimized some applications and forgot you didn't have an Iconbox.
      Or maybe you don't like the Iconbox and usually use KDE or GNOME's panel
      to recover them and forgot to launch them. Never fear. You can always
      middle click on the <a class="link" href="#dragbar" title="The Dragbar">Dragbar</a> and get a
      <a class="link" href="#rootmenu" title="Menus">menu</a> that will allow you to recover
      them. You can also Alt or Ctrl-Middleclick on the desktop to get the
      same menus (in case you don't have a Dragbar anymore).</p><p>Remember, at any time you can always create a new <a class="link" href="#iconbox" title="The Iconbox">Iconbox</a> to catch your applications as they
      minimize, if you want to re-enable it. Unfortunately you'll have to
      reconfigure it since each Iconbox can have its own <a class="link" href="#settings" title="Settings">settings</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="properties"></a>Remembering Application Properties</h3></div></div></div><p>In the <a class="link" href="#windowops" title="The Window Operations Menu">Window Operations</a> menu of
      every window you will see an entry labeled "Remember...". If you select
      this it will bring up the "Remember" dialog for that window.</p><p>This dialog lets you selectively snapshot certain attributes of
      that window at that time and have e16 remember them. You may choose to
      only remember some of the attributes, and possibly not have the
      application started automatically for you. Choose what you want e16 to
      remember about that window and hit "Apply" or "OK" if you don't need the
      dialog anymore, and e16 will, the next time that instance of the
      application is run, apply the current location, size, border style or
      any other attribute to that window. E16 can also launch the application
      for you upon startup if you so wish.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="settings"></a>Settings</h3></div></div></div><p>When you click the right mouse button on the desktop background
      you will pop up the Settings menu. Clicking "Settings" will bring up the
      Settings Dialog. From here you can select an aspect of e16 to configure
      to your liking. There are too many settings to actually document fully
      right now, but the likelihood is if you want a particular behavior from
      e16, it is achievable by merely playing with these options.</p><p>Combinations of options are often required to get the effect you
      want, so some experimentation may be required. Do not be frightened.
      Nothing you can do can't be undone by simply changing the options back
      to how they were and clicking on Apply again.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="groups"></a>Window Groups</h3></div></div></div><p>Sometimes you have a number of windows on your desktop that
      logically go together. E16 allows you to group windows together, so that
      whenever you change a property of one window in a group, the change is
      reflected on the other group members. If you have a group whose members
      span multiple <a class="link" href="#desktops" title="Multiple &amp; Virtual Desktops">desktops</a>, changing a
      group's property affects only windows of that group that are on the
      current desktop.</p><p>The properties that you can change for an entire group include
      setting the window border, iconifying, killing, moving,
      raising/lowering, sticking and shading of a window.</p><p>To define what properties are applied to a group by default, you
      go to the <a class="link" href="#settings" title="Settings">Settings Dialog</a> and select
      "Groups", which will give you a dialog window in which you can configure
      the settings.</p><p>There are two different methods for manipulating window groups.
      First, there's a comprehensive sub-menu available in each window's
      operations menu called "Window Groups". You also are able to configure
      the group individually apart from the default group settings.</p><p>The second way is the window title bar, which has the most
      important options directly available for convenience. Shift-click to
      start a group, Ctrl-clicking to add a window to the youngest group (also
      referred to as the "current" group) and Shift-Ctrl-Click to destroying a
      group. You can also click the middle mouse button for visualizing the
      group(s) of a window. Click again to returning to the previous
      border.</p><p>Windows can be in multiple groups at the same time, so for many
      options you have to indicate which group you are referring to. Selecting
      the appropriate checkboxes (showing the group members' titles) at the
      top of the dialog windows.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="backgrounds"></a>Selecting and Adding backgrounds</h3></div></div></div><p>Often you will want to change the background of a particular
      desktop. There are several ways you can do this. But of course, to
      change your desktop, you'll need to give e16 some graphics to play with.
      A desktop theme may add a background or two to your available
      selections, but most users want to have even more backgrounds to choose
      from. To add backgrounds to your selection, make a backgrounds directory
      under your home directory. To do this using most shells you can
      type</p><pre class="programlisting">$ mkdir ~/.e16/backgrounds</pre><p>Once you have added your backgrounds, you should be able to go to
      the root menu desktop selector. To get to this menu, middle click on the
      desktop, select "Desktop", and go to Backgrounds. From here you will be
      able to navigate the backgrounds menus.</p><p>Selecting any of the images there will change the desktop
      background of the current desktop to the image that you have
      selected.</p><p>E16 will attempt to choose the best settings for a particular
      background, but if it gets it wrong you can always change the settings
      by hand. To do this bring up the <a class="link" href="#settings" title="Settings">Settings
      Dialog</a> and select "Background". You can use this dialog to change
      your background, too, as well as fine-tune all the various settings for
      each individual background available.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tooltips"></a>Tooltips</h3></div></div></div><p>From time to time, as you use e16, if you don't remember what does
      what, if you keep the mouse still for a little bit a tooltip will pop
      up. The easiest example of this is when you hold the mouse over a <a class="link" href="#border" title="Using the Window Border">Window Border</a>.</p><p>You can disable the tooltips or change the delay before they pop
      up by selecting "Tooltips" in the <a class="link" href="#settings" title="Settings">Settings
      Dialog</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="audio"></a>Audio</h3></div></div></div><p>Of course, e16 comes preconfigured to play lots of little blips
      and beeps when you do various things on your desktop. In order to use
      sound in e16, you must have both EsounD and audiofile installed.</p><p>You can enable and/or disable sound at runtime by selecting
      "Sound" in the <a class="link" href="#settings" title="Settings">Settings Dialog</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="focus"></a>Setting the Focus</h3></div></div></div><p>E16 offers lots of different options for focusing windows. By
      default, it comes up in sloppy focus mode. There are two other primary
      focus modes supported by e16 - click to focus and pointer focus.</p><p>Click To Focus most people are familiar with. You click on a
      window and it receives the focus from e16.</p><p>Pointer Focus gives the focus to whichever window the pointer is
      sitting over</p><p>Sloppy Focus is similar to Pointer Focus, except that if you go
      over the <a class="link" href="#backgrounds" title="Selecting and Adding backgrounds">Desktop Background</a> you still
      are focused on the last window</p><p>E16 allows you to change your focus settings at any time. Simply
      bring up the <a class="link" href="#settings" title="Settings">Settings Dialog</a> and select
      "Focus". At the top, we can select between our three focus modes.</p><p>We can also enable some other features, such as one that will
      allow a simple <a class="link" href="#mousebind" title="Mouse Bindings">mouse</a> click to raise any
      window to the foreground, as well as several other advanced focus
      settings.</p><p>Here we can also enable the focus list feature. The focus list is
      a window list that pops up as you cycle through your focus using the
      ALT+TAB <a class="link" href="#defkeys" title="Default Keybindings">Keybinding</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="movemode"></a>Moving Windows</h3></div></div></div><p>E16 comes with several different available methods for moving a
      window. You can perform the actual moves using the Window <a class="link" href="#border" title="Using the Window Border">Border</a>, or by using the available <a class="link" href="#mousebind" title="Mouse Bindings">Mouse Bindings</a>. This will cause the window to
      move until you have released the mouse button.</p><p>To change the mode that the moving of the windows uses (opaque
      being the default), open up the <a class="link" href="#settings" title="Settings">Settings
      Dialog</a>, and select "Move/Resize". You can select the mode from a
      list. Experiment until you find one that suits you best.</p><p>For some serious eye candy, try out the Translucent move mode.
      This will only work if your X server and e16 are running on the same
      machine, however.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="resizemode"></a>Resizing Windows</h3></div></div></div><p>E16 also comes with several available methods for resizing
      windows. You can perform the actual resize on the window by clicking on
      any resize-handle of your window <a class="link" href="#border" title="Using the Window Border">border</a>
      and dragging to the desired size. You can also get the same effect by
      using the ALT + middle button <a class="link" href="#mousebind" title="Mouse Bindings">Mouse
      Binding</a> in any part of the window.</p><p>To change the mode that the resizing of the windows uses (opaque
      being the default), open up the <a class="link" href="#settings" title="Settings">Settings
      Dialog</a>, and select "Move/Resize". You can select the mode from a
      list. Experiment until you find one that suits you best.</p><p>The best eye candy resize mode is probably technical move mode.
      This mode shows you the height and width of the window, in addition to
      the distance from the nearest edge.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="windowops"></a>The Window Operations Menu</h3></div></div></div><p>The Window Operations menu is a commonly used menu that allows you
      to perform many different actions onto the current window.</p><p>The Close function closes the window in question. Annihilate
      destroys the window without regard to the application the window belongs
      to, which is especially useful if the application refuses to respond to
      being closed with Close.</p><p>The Iconify function iconifies the window. If you have an <a class="link" href="#iconbox" title="The Iconbox">Iconbox</a> it is sent to the nearest one.</p><p>The Raise function raises the window above any windows that may be
      obscuring it and Lower lowers it below windows it is obscuring.</p><p></p><p>Shade/Unshade toggles the shaded state of the window. Note that
      borderless windows are not allowed to be shaded.</p><p>Stick/Unstick toggles the sticky state of a window. A window that
      is sticky remains "stuck to the glass" and thus is visible on all
      virtual and multiple <a class="link" href="#desktops" title="Multiple &amp; Virtual Desktops">desktops</a>.</p><p>Fullscreen/Window zooms in and out of the window by changing
      screen resolution. This feature will only work if you have your X server
      configured correctly and it supports the XVidtune extension. Your X
      server may not like having resolutions changed - it is possible that an
      unstable X server could crash if you use this. Be aware of this when
      using this feature.</p><p>Remember... displays the <a class="link" href="#properties" title="Remembering Application Properties">Remember
      Properties</a> dialog that lets you select things to remember about
      this instance of an application. The attributes selected to be
      remembered in the state they are when you hit Apply or Ok in this
      dialog. You will have to bring it up again if you wish to remember a new
      state of the window.</p><p></p><p>In the <a class="link" href="#groups" title="Window Groups">Window Groups</a> sub-menu there
      are various options for configuring window groups and how this window
      relates to any groups you may have.</p><p>You can quickly modify the size of a window to one of several
      aspects of maximum sizes using the Window Size sub-menu.</p><p>Set Stacking lets you change the stacking layer of that
      window.</p><p>You can change the <a class="link" href="#changeborder" title="Changing Window Borders">border</a>
      using the Set Border Style menu if you wish to use a different window
      border. If you change themes after you have changed the border, and the
      new theme doesn't provide a border of the same name, the window will
      fall back to using the DEFAULT border until you change it again.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="placement"></a>Window Placement</h3></div></div></div><p>Selecting "Placement" in the <a class="link" href="#settings" title="Settings">Settings
      Dialog </a> allows you to configure various options for the placement
      of windows. The two Dialog window options are for windows like the ALT+O
      open URL window in Netscape. Manual Placement will force you to use the
      mouse to position every new window that attempts to map itself.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="eesh"></a>E16 and IPC</h3></div></div></div><p>E16 has a fairly interesting IPC system that allows external
      applications (such as Eterm) to talk to e16 and both ask for information
      and change information. There is a program that was installed with e16
      called "eesh" that is a simple shell interface to the IPC in e16. It's
      even got its own documentation. You can go into eesh and type "help" and
      it should spit back a list of commands that it understands.</p><p>Note: there are many commands that will show up in E's IPC that
      don't necessarily work yet, or aren't fully implemented. You CAN
      potentially do some really bizarre things to your system by using eesh,
      but for the most part it's just another interesting interface to E. In
      your distribution package you should have received some sample scripts
      written in Perl that interface to E through eesh showing how you can
      externally script E to do more things outside E's base functionality.
      Expect the IPC to flesh out even more in future revisions.</p><p>To exit eesh, hit CTRL + D (EOF)</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="editmenus"></a>Editing E16's Menus</h3></div></div></div><p>The first time you run e16 as a user after you've installed it, it
      should create a directory under your home directory called .e16/menus.
      In this directory, there will be a file called "file.menu" - this file
      controls the contents of your left-mouse button <a class="link" href="#rootmenu" title="Menus">Menu</a>. The very first line of this file
      contains the title for the menu, and the remainder of the file looks
      something like this:</p><p>"Eterm" NULL exec "Eterm"</p><p>Where each column represents:</p><p>Entry title, graphic for menu (or NULL), exec "commandline"</p><p>You may have several files in here, including a KDE menu and a
      Gnome menu if e16 has detected their presence during installation. If
      detected, your primary apps will be located in another file called
      user_apps.menu. Each of these files is for you to edit as
      desired.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="editkeys"></a>Editing Your Keybindings</h3></div></div></div><p>To set your own keybindings, all you have to do is find the
      bindings.cfg file that was installed with e16, and make a copy in your
      ~/.e16 directory. This file shouldn't be too difficult to edit. Be
      careful! The keybindings in this file will override ALL the default
      keybindings, as long as this file exists, so edit this file with extreme
      caution (unless you know what you're doing).</p><p>To reset your keybindings back to the default, simply remove this
      file from your ~/.e16 directory. The next time you restart e16 it should
      reload the default keybindings into memory.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="themes"></a>E16 and Themes</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the strong points of e16, of course, is that you can change
      around the complete look and feel of your desktop whenever you want to.
      The e16 package itself includes only the "winter" theme. Additional
      themes are distributed in the e16-themes package. You can select the the
      theme from the <a class="link" href="#rootmenu" title="Menus">Settings menu</a>, going to
      the "Themes" selector, and then choosing a new theme.</p><p>Many more themes are available elsewhere, see <a class="link" href="#res" title="Resources">themes</a></p><p>To install a new theme is simple: all you need to do is take the
      bleh.etheme file and drop it into your ~/.e16/themes directory. Once
      you've restarted e16, it will automatically show up in your Themes <a class="link" href="#rootmenu" title="Menus">menu</a>, and you can choose it just like any
      other theme.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="eyecandy"></a>E16's Eye candy Features</h3></div></div></div><p>Of course, e16 wouldn't be complete without just a few bits of eye
      candy to play with.</p><p>On the "FX" <a class="link" href="#settings" title="Settings">settings</a> dialog you
      can chose two toys:</p><p>The ripples effect - this causes little ripples of water to
      reflect on the bottom of your screen.</p><p>The waves effect - similar to ripples, but this one waves up and
      down as opposed to side-to-side</p><p>On the "Transparency" <a class="link" href="#settings" title="Settings">settings</a>
      dialog you can enable "Theme Transparency". A slider controls the
      opacity of the window borders, etc. with respect to the desktop
      background.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="maint"></a>Included Maintenance Scripts</h3></div></div></div><p>E16 comes with several scripts that are executable out of the
      middle mouse button/Maintenance menu - these scripts can perform all
      sorts of maintenance on the files that e16 creates automatically for
      you. You can also rebuild the menus from here.</p><p>As a warning, when you purge configuration information, the next
      time you restart e16 it will take longer to load. You can monitor e16's
      usage using the query tools provided. If you change themes a lot you
      will probably want to purge the config file cache after you've settled
      on a theme. This will help keep your disk usage by e16 down.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm907006316"></a>Q: I can't find my <a class="link" href="#iconbox" title="The Iconbox">Iconbox</a> or

        all of e16's automatically saved files. Go into ~/.e16, and remove the
        e_config* files, and then blow away the cached directory. The next
